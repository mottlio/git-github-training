When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I wanted to collaborate with others and if I wanted to have a back-up in the 'cloud' for my local repository. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might want to determine the moment when your changes are merged with someone elses. You might be in the process of introducing an important change (still incomplete) which could be overridden by the old version or someone elses new version. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones on GitHub
    Clones are copies of a repository (remote or local) stored locally
    Branches are sequences of commits that can be merged. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can work on it offline. You can merge it into master without pulling. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    By storing the whole repository on Dropbox. Any changes would have to be documented very accurately and communicated via a chat programme (like Hipchat). After making changes on the local computer - a new version of the filw would have to be uploaded to a 'transition' folder to be vetted by others before replacing its ancestor. It would take more time to submit changes and there would be a greater risk of mistakes. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Ability to experiment. Ability to consult changes with others before including them in a final project.
